# Email Spam Classification

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for accurate email spam classification. By leveraging algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (J48), and Random Forest, the system efficiently distinguishes between spam and legitimate messages, streamlining email management and enhancing cybersecurity.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Collection and Preparation:** The project begins with the acquisition of a labeled dataset containing both spam and non-spam emails. These emails serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the classification models.

- **Algorithm Selection and Training:** Three powerful algorithms are employed in the classification process:
   - *Naive Bayes:* A probabilistic approach that excels in text classification tasks.
   - *Decision Tree (J48):* A tree-based method known for its interpretability and efficiency.
   - *Random Forest:* An ensemble learning technique that harnesses the strength of multiple decision trees.

- **Accuracy and Performance Metrics:** The project meticulously measures the accuracy, execution time, and error rate of each algorithm, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness in classifying spam emails.

- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Classification reports are generated to offer a detailed overview of each algorithm's performance, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions about email management strategies.

- **Interactive Visualization:** The project incorporates visually appealing plots to showcase the comparative accuracy of the classification algorithms, aiding in a quick and intuitive assessment.
